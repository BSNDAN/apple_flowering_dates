# Internship : Predict apple trees flowering date from images

My goal is to predict apple trees flowering dates from images. I use convolutional network architectures to make these predictions.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## About the project

My goal is to predict dates of apple trees flowering dates from images captured by a drone in June, September, October and November 2021. For each month, an orthomosaic gathering all the images taken during a capture was constituted. 

The first part of my work is to constitute a data set from these orthomosaics such as each tree is characterized by an image (what I call a patch) for each month. 

The second part is to optimize an architecture of deep neural network to predict the flowering dates. 

### Methods Used
